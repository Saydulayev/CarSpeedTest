# Speed Measurement App

This iOS app allows users to measure their acceleration and track their speed in real-time using GPS data. It provides a graphical representation of acceleration data over time and allows users to view and manage their speed history.

## Features

- Real-time speed measurement: The app uses GPS data to calculate and display the user's current speed in kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph).
- Graphical representation: The app visualizes the acceleration data on a line chart, providing a clear overview of speed changes over time.
- History tracking: Users can view a history of their speed measurements, including the acceleration value and timestamp.
- Measurement customization: Users can adjust the measurement interval, display precision, and preferred speed unit in the settings.
- Data export: The app allows users to export their acceleration data in JSON format for further analysis or sharing.

## Technologies Used

- SwiftUI: The user interface is built using SwiftUI, Apple's declarative framework for creating iOS apps.
- CoreLocation: The CoreLocation framework is utilized to access GPS data and calculate speed and acceleration.
- SwiftUICharts: The SwiftUICharts library is used for visualizing the acceleration data on a line chart.
